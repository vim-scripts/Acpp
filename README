If we call ":Acpp" when editing "/path/to/file/src/ae/cmd/File.cpp", VIM opens complementary "/path/to/file/include/ae/cmd/File.h" file, and vice versa. That is, it searches for the last occurrence of "/src/" or "/include/" and changes this along with the file extension (h to cpp, and cpp to h).
NOTE: This works with ONLY single occurrence of "/src/" or "/include/"
If current full path doesn't contain "/src/" or "/include/" and/or does not end with "h" or "cpp" then "Acpp" opens a file named "0"

It does not strictly depend on Vim 7, it's just the version I have, the script should work fine with previous versions too.
