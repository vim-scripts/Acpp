If you call "Acpp" when editing "/path/to/file/src/Window.cpp", the script:
* sees if there's "/path/to/file/src/" directory;
** if so:
*** switch to "/path/to/file/include/Window" if it exists;
*** switch to "/path/to/file/include/Window.h" even if it doesn't exist;
** if not:
*** switch to "/path/to/file/src/Window" if it exists;
*** switch to "/path/to/file/src/Window.h" even if it doesn't exist.

If you call "Acpp" when editing "/path/to/file/include/Window"
or "/path/to/file/include/Window.h", the script:
* sees if there's "/path/to/file/src/" directory;
** if so:
*** switch to "/path/to/file/src/Window.cpp" even if it doesn't exist.

It does not strictly depend on Vim 7, it's just the version I have, the script should work fine with previous versions too.
